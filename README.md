# All the Prologs

ðŸš§ This repo is work-in-progress, it isn't documented and may not even work!

The idea behind this repo is to have a usable docker container ultimately for
*all* Prolog implementations out there, to be able to easily test portability
of your code.

Currently it supports only handful of them, but it will support much more. I
have a lot of them working on my machine, but I will need to package them to
properly include here.

## Usage

If you use Arch Linux you can build packages yourself, but I plan to host
pre-build binaries to simplify it.

 1. Build packages (it may fail for a number of reasons, beware)

        make repo

 2. If you've built all the packages (the hard part), then it just works:

        make run

    This command will create a Docker image and it will run `test.pl` for all
    currently supported engines. If you want to test another default goal or
    different program file the simple redefine some variables:

        make run PROG=myprog.pl MAIN=mymain


## Currently working

SWI, Scryer, GNU, Ciao, Trealla.

## Anticipated implementations

Bin, ECLiPSe, Projog, B, Tu, Tau, SICStus, (if you have purchased the key),
Pop, Doge (JavaScript, Python, Java), Yap, XSB.

## Tried and wouldn't be supported

  * [JLog][a]â€“ only GUI, but works Ok with cyclic terms.

        jlog: $(PROG)
        	java -jar /opt/jlog/1.3.6/JLog.jar

    JScriptLog has stuck in unfinished state from 2007, it runs, but it seems to
    support only hardcoded KB â€“ some development is required.

  * [LPA-Prolog][b] â€“ commercial license is needed.
  * [Brain Aid Prolog][c] â€“ can't find sources.
  * [Strawberry Prolog][d] â€“ full IDE no easy way to integrate
    into CLI.
  * [DGKS Prolog][e] â€“ Looks like a someone's toy project from late 90', no CLI
    interface without writing custom Java code, can't handle operators correctly.

        dgks:
        	java -cp /usr/local/src/dgks-prolog/PrologO.zip prolog.dgks.prolog

  * Turbo Prolog â€“ can't find source and it seems to be a lot of pain anyways.
    Links:
      * [Turbo Prolog Goodies][f]
  * [Quintus Prolog][g] â€“ sources are paywalled, no real reason to use because
    it's successor SICStus is available.
  * [Minerva Prolog][h] â€“ source code is unobtainium now.
  * [C# Prolog][i] â€“ doesn't support cyclic terms and has non-standard exception
    handling.

        csh: $(PROG)
        	cd '/opt/C#Prolog SF4.1' && env MONO_PATH=CSProlog/obj/Debug mono PLd/obj/Debug/PLd.exe "['$(realpath $<)'],$(MAIN),halt."

  * [Amzi! Prolog][j] â€“ looks like a complete IDE, hard to compile.
  * [Jinni Prolog][k] â€“ code is freely availvable, but I don't have stamina to
    fix all compilation issues.
  * [IF/Prolog][l] â€“ there are some very old sources, it might work or might not.
  * [BIM Prolog][m] â€“ A lot of information, but no sources nor executables.
  * [Jekejeke Prolog][n] â€“ I have found archived page, but .jar file wasn't
    archived and I don't like downloading it from random sites on internet.
